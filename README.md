# Install

Want to install this godforsaken theme yourself? There's 4 easy steps. Lets go!
- Install ClaudiaIDE extension on Visual Studio
	- Extensions >> Manage Extensions >> Search >> Claudia (make sure to close VS after pressing install)
- Install "Color Theme Editor for Visual Studio 2019". (Again make sure to actually install it by closing VS and not just letting it stay in the queue)
- Edit your Claudia settings. This is the extension that adds the image to the background. There are the settings that I use.  You can use any background image. Mine is in the repo.

- Last but not least import the theme. Download the repo and then go to Tools >> Customize colors >> Import theme. Then just import `neotokyo.vstheme` from the repo
